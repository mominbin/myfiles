when i happen to meet a problem on the git fetch command,which is like this:
fatal:Refusing to fetch into current branch refs/heads/master of non-bare repository
And I got the answer in the stackoverflow.com.
use the command as follow:
git remote add otherrepo thehost:/the/path.git
my detail is: git remote add myfiles git@github.com:mominbin/myfiles.git
it looks like we should always do this like this after we clone a repository.
