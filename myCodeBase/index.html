			We’ve also begun tracking unresolved browser bugs that currently impact Bootstrap’s development in some way. We call it the Wall of browser bugs. One of the coolest parts of developing Bootstrap is finding and reporting browser bugs to their developers. We’re literally helping to make the web a better place, and that’s pretty awesome in our book.

					Rorschach automatically gives instant feedback on Bootstrap pull requests that suffer from one of several simple mistakes, thus decreasing turnaround time on fixing the pull request. The bot refers the contributor to new documentation we’ve written to explain each of the mistakes in detail, along with how to correct them, thus decreasing friction for contributors.

					Previously, these mistakes were checked for manually, which meant there was often a delay before the mistake was noticed and that pull request reviewers had to manually explain the mistake to the contributor each time. With Rorschach, everyone should have a smoother experience working on Bootstrap.

					After hanging out on the Bootstrap issue tracker for a long time, you start to notice some common mistakes folks make (besides just plain invalid HTML). Many of them are covered in our documentation, but our docs can be lengthy and some of the mistakes are pretty subtle or have non-obvious causes.
